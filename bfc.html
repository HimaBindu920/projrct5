        <p style="font-size:30px"><b><u>PREPARATION</u></b></p>
        <b>Step 1:</b><br><br>
        Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour two 9-inch round cake pans; line bottoms with parchment<br> paper. Place a medium bowl in the refrigerator to chill.<br><br>
        <b>Step 2:</b><br><br>
        Whisk flour, sugar, cocoa, baking powder, baking soda, and salt together in a large bowl. Add eggs, milk, oil, and vanilla; <br>beat until combined. Pour cake batter into the prepared pans.<br><br>
        <b>Step 3:</b><br><br>
        Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the centers comes out clean, about 35 minutes. Cool layers in<br> pans on wire racks for 10 minutes. Run a paring knife around edges to loosen and invert carefully onto racks<br> to cool completely, 1 to 2 hours. <br><br>
        <b>Step 4:</b><br><br>
        While cake layers bake, drain cherries for topping, reserving 1/2 cup juice. Combine reserved juice, cherries, sugar, and <br>cornstarch in a 2-quart saucepan. Cook, stirring constantly, over low heat until thickened. Stir in vanilla.<br> Let cool at room temperature for 30 minutes. Transfer to the refrigerator to cool completely before assembling cake.<br><br>
        <b>Step 5:</b><br><br>
        Combine whipping cream and confectioners' sugar for frosting in the chilled medium bowl. Beat with an electric mixer at high speed <br>until stiff peaks form.<br><br>
        <b>Step 6:</b><br><br>
        Split each cake layer in half horizontally using a long serrated knife. Tear one layer into crumbs; set aside. Gently brush loose <br>crumbs off top and sides of remaining layers using a pastry brush or your hands. Reserve 1 1/2 cups frosting <br>for piping decorations on cake; set aside.<br><br>
        <b>Step 7:</b><br><br>
        To assemble, place one cake layer on a cake plate. Spread with 1 cup frosting; top with 3/4 cup cherry topping<br>. Top with second cake layer; repeat layers of frosting and cherry topping. Top with third cake layer and frost sides of cake.<br><br>
        <b>Step 8:</b><br><br>
        Pat reserved cake crumbs onto sides of cake. Spoon reserved 1 1/2 cups frosting into a pastry bag fitted with a star decorator tip. <br>Pipe around top and bottom edges of cake. Spoon remaining cherry topping on top of cake.Store covered in the <br>refrigerator until ready to serve.<br><br>
