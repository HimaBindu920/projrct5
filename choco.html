        <b>Step 1:</b><br><br>
        Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Butter two 8-inch x 2-inch round cake pans.<br> Line with parchment paper, then butter and flour the pans.<br><br>
        <b>Step 2:</b><br><br>
        Sift the flour, sugar, cocoa, baking soda, baking powder, and salt into the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with a paddle attachment<br> and mix on low speed until combined. In another bowl, combine the buttermilk, oil, eggs, and vanilla. With the mixer on low speed, <br>slowly add the wet ingredients to the dry<br><br>
        <b>Step 3:</b><br><br>
        With mixer still on low, add the coffee and stir just to combine, scraping the bottom of the bowl with a rubber spatula.<br>Pour the batter into the prepared pans and bake for 35 to 40 minutes, until a cake tester comes out clean. Cool in the pans for <br>30 minutes,then turn them out onto a cooling rack and cool completely.<br><br>
        <b>Step 4:</b><br><br>
        Place 1 layer, flat side up, on a flat plate or cake pedestal. With a knife or offset spatula, spread the top with frosting.<br> Place the second layer on top, rounded side up, and spread the frosting evenly on the top and sides of the cake.<br><br>
        <b>Step 5:</b><br><br>
        Chop the chocolate and place it in a heat-proof bowl set over a pan of simmering water. Stir until just melted and <br>set aside until cooled to room temperature. <br><br>
        <b>Step 6:</b><br><br>
        In the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, beat the butter on medium-high speed until light yellow and fluffy,<br> about 3 minutes. Add the egg yolk and vanilla and continue beating for 3 minutes. Turn the mixer to low, gradually add the<br> confectioners' sugar, then beat at medium speed, scraping down the bowl as necessary, until smooth and creamy.<br><br>
        <b>Step 6:</b><br><br>
        Dissolve the coffee powder in 2 teaspoons of the hottest tap water. On low speed, add the chocolate and coffee to the butter <br>mixture and mix until blended. Don't whip! Spread immediately on the cooled cake.<br><br>
