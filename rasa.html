<b>Yield:</b>4 servings<br>

        <p style="font-size:30px"><b><u>PREPARATION</u></b></p>
        <b>Step 1:</b><br><br>
        Bring the milk to a boil in a heavy-bottomed pan till it starts foaming;<br> immediately add the lime juice and stir. It will curdle right away. You should see the <br>milk solids (chenna) separate from the whey. Pour into a colander lined with cheesecloth;<br>rinse the chenna with cold water to get rid of the lime juice. <br><br>
        <b>Step 2:</b><br><br>
        Allow the water to drain completely.Gather the muslin cloth edges like a parcel and express as much water as possible;<br>what you now have is soft paneer. Turn the paneer onto a rolling mat or other smooth surface.<br><br>
        <b>Step 3:</b><br><br>
        Knead the paneer well to make a smooth paste. Roll into a ball and divide into 20 equal portions.Bring the water <br>to a boil in a pressure cooker; stir the sugar into the boiling water until dissolved.<br><br>
        <b>Step 4:</b><br><br>
        Roll each portion of paneer into a smooth ball between your palms, making sure there are no cracks; gently drop <br>the balls into the hot syrup. Secure the lid onto the pressure cooker and bring to pressure. <br><br>
        <b>Step 5:</b><br><br>
        Reduce heat to medium-low and pressure cook for 6 minutes.Release the pressure from the cooker while running under <br>water; remove the lid. The rasgullas should be floating on the syrup and have expanded 2 or 3 times in size.<br><br>
        <b>Step 6:</b><br><br>
        Pour the rasgullas and syrup into a bowl. Gently stir the cardamom into the mixture. Refrigerate to chill completely<br> before serving cold.<br><br>
