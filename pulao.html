        <p style="font-size:30px"><b><u>PREPARATION</u></b></p>
        <b>Step 1:</b><br><br>
        Soak the basmati rice for 15 minutes in room temperature water, then drain well.<br><br>
        
        <b>Step 2:</b><br><br>
        In a large (preferably deep) skillet over medium heat, melt the ghee. Add the <br>cinnamon, cardamom, bay leaf, cumin and peppercorns and toast until fragrant and the cumin turns a slightly darker shade<br> of brown, 1 to 2 minutes. Swirl in the turmeric and let it dissolve into the ghee.<br><br>
        
        <b>Step 3:</b><br><br>
        Add the onion and chile and cook, stirring occasionally, until the onion is soft and translucent, 4 to 6 minutes.<br><br>
        
        <b>Step 4:</b><br><br>
        Add the potato cubes, toss to coat them in the spices and spread in a single layer. Cook, undisturbed, until the potatoes<br> are starting to soften and form a light golden crust on the bottom, 5 to 7 minutes — do not let them cook all the way through,<br> or they’ll be mushy in the finished dish.<br><br>
        
        <b>Step 5:</b><br><br>
        Add the drained rice and carrots, toss everything with the spices and cook 1 minute.<br><br>
        
        <b>Step 6:</b><br><br>
        Stir in the peas, salt and 2 cups of water. Bring to a boil over high heat, then turn the heat down to maintain a simmer. <br>Cover the pulao and cook for 15 minutes, then turn the heat off and let rest, still covered, for 10 minutes. After 10 minutes,<br> the water should be fully absorbed and the grains fluffy and light yellow. If not, put the pulao back over low heat, and let it<br> cook for a few more minutes, covered.<br><br>
        
        <b>Step 7:</b><br><br>
        Divide the pulao among bowls and, if desired, top each with a dollop of yogurt and a small spoonful of ghee.<br><br>
