        <p style="font-size:30px"><b><u>PREPARATION</u></b></p>
        <b>Step 1:</b><br><br>
        Finely grate 1 tsp. lemon zest into a small bowl. Squeeze in juice from one half<br> of the lemon. Add sugar, 1 cup yogurt, 1 tsp. salt, and ¼ tsp. pepper. Finely <br>chop one-quarter of the onion and stir into raita. Let sit at room temperature at least 1 hour<br> or chill up to overnight.<br><br>
        <b>Step 2:</b><br><br>
        Purée ginger, garlic, cinnamon, cardamom, juice of remaining lemon half, and remaining three-quarters <br>of onion, ½ cup yogurt, 2 tsp. salt, and ¾ tsp. pepper in a blender until smooth. Transfer to a medium bowl.<br><br>
        <b>Step 3:</b><br><br>
        Using your hands, pull skin off chicken thighs and discard. (Don’t worry about any straggly bits of skin and fat; they will render<br> out during cooking.) Transfer to bowl with ginger mixture, add bay leaves, and toss to combine. Cover with a plate and <br>let marinate at room temperature at least 2 hours or preferably chill up to overnight.<br><br>
        <b>Step 4:</b><br><br>
        Place a rack in lower third of oven; preheat to 350°. Bring salt and 3 qt. water to a rapid boil in a large pot over high heat.<br><br>
        <b>Step 5:</b><br><br>
        Meanwhile, place rice in a medium bowl. Cover with cool tap water, use your hand to gently agitate the grains, and drain. <br>Repeat at least 2 more times until water runs clear enough to see your hand through it.<br><br>
        <b>Step 6:</b><br><br>
        Add drained rice all at once to boiling salted water. Initially the water will stop boiling and the rice will sink to the bottom.<br> Stir a few times with a wooden spoon to prevent sticking, then stop stirring. After a couple of minutes, the water will return<br> to a simmer and a few grains will begin appearing near the surface. The rice is ready to drain when the grains have<br> nearly doubled in size, the water returns to a boil, and most of the rice rapidly bubbles to the surface. When you bite into <br>a grain, you want to see a hard white core; just like pasta cooked al dente, the grains should remain firm. Depending on the <br>quality of your rice, this can take anywhere from 3–7 minutes, so begin tasting the grains early. Drain rice and rinse with water <br>until cool. Set aside.<br><br>
        <b>Step 7:</b><br><br>
        Cook onion and ghee in a 4–6-qt. Dutch oven over medium-high heat, stirring constantly, until onions are golden and crisp,<br> 8–10 minutes. The sides and bottom of pot may brown and even develop some char. Don’t worry, <br>this is a-okay! Color adds character! Using a slotted spoon, transfer onions to a plate.<br><br>
        <b>Step 8:</b><br><br>
        Reduce heat to medium-low and toast nuts in ghee in same pot, stirring occasionally, until fragrant and darkened in color,<br> 2–3 minutes. Using slotted spoon, transfer nuts to another plate; set aside for serving. Transfer half of ghee in pot<br> to a small bowl; set aside.<br><br>
        <b>Step 9:</b><br><br>
        Increase heat to medium-high and sprinkle sugar over remaining ghee in pot. Cook, stirring frequently,<br> until sugar forms deeply caramelized clumps, 3–5 minutes. Add chicken, scraping in marinade,and bring to a simmer.<br> Remove from heat and arrange chicken and marinade in an even layer. Sprinkle with dried fruit and one-third of fried onions. <br>Top with rice. Poke 5–7 holes into rice with the back of a wooden spoon until you reach the chicken. Drizzle reserved ghee<br> over and top with another third of fried onions. <br><br>
        <b>Step 10:</b><br><br>
        Cover with a tight-fitting lid and return to medium heat. Cook until you can hear the chicken gurgling in the pot and wisps of steam<br> just begin to escape from lid, about 5 minutes. Do not open the lid at any point! If you peek, you will risk losing too <br>much steam, preventing the rice from properly cooking through. Transfer pot to oven and bake, covered, 45 minutes. <br>Let rest at least 15 minutes and up to 1 hour before uncovering.Serve alongside onion raita while ghee is <br>still hot and rice is steamy.<br><br>
