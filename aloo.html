        <p style="font-size:30px"><b><u>PREPARATION</u></b></p>
        <b>Step 1:</b><br><br>
        Mix together the Mashed Potatoes, flour, egg, parsley, Parmesan, <br>mozzarella and black pepper in a bowl. Place the breadcrumbs on a large plate.<br><br>
        <b>Step 2:</b><br><br>
        Form the potato mix into 12 golf-ball-sized balls. The mixture will be a little sticky, so wet your hands a little as you go. <br>Place the balls directly on the breadcrumbs and roll each ball in the breadcrumbs, pressing to make sure they stick well. <br>Put the breadcrumbed balls on a plate.<br><br>
        <b>Step 3:</b><br><br>
        Heat 2 inches of oil in a deep skillet or Dutch oven to 375 degrees F, or until the mixture bubbles when a breadcrumb is added.<br><br>
        <b>Step 4:</b><br><br>
        Add the balls to the oil and fry until golden brown on all sides, 3 to 5 minutes total. Remove to a paper towel-lined plate and <br>sprinkle immediately with salt.Garnish with more Parmesan and parsley.<br><br>
        <b>Step 5:</b><br><br>
        Peel and cut the potatoes into pieces of approximately the same size. Bring a large pot of water to a simmer and add the potatoes.<br> Bring to a boil and cook until a fork easily slides into the potatoes with no resistance and the potatoes almost, <br>but not totally, fall apart, 30 to 35 minutes.
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.<br><br>
        <b>Step 6:</b><br><br>
        Drain the potatoes in a large colander. Place them back into the dry pot and put the pot on the stove.<br> Mash the potatoes over a low heat, <br>allowing all the steam to escape.
Turn off the stove and add the butter, cream cheese and half-and-half.<br> Mash, mash, mash! Add the seasoned salt and black pepper.<br><br>
<b>Step 7:</b><br><br>
Stir well and place in a medium baking dish. Throw a few pats of butter over the top of the potatoes and place bake until<br> the butter has melted and the potatoes are warmed through, a few minutes.<br><br>
