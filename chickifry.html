        <p style="font-size:30px"><b><u>PREPARATION</u></b></p>
        <b>Step 1:</b><br><br>
        Pat the chicken dry with paper towels. Cut into 1-inch pieces with a knife.<br>Season with salt and pepper.<br><br>
        <b>Step 2:</b><br><br>
        In a large bowl, whisk together the chicken broth, coconut aminos, and honey. Add the chicken pieces and stir to coat.<br> Set aside to marinate for 15 minutes, or up to 24 hours.<br><br>
        <b>Step 3:</b><br><br>
        Meanwhile, heat 2 tablespoons of oil in a large, heavy-bottom wok over medium-high heat, until very hot. To test this, add a <br>drop of water – it’s ready when the water sizzles away immediately.<br><br>
        <b>Step 4:</b><br><br>
        Add the mushrooms. Stir fry for 4-6 minutes, until mushrooms are soft.

Add the broccoli, peas, and bell peppers. Season lightly with <br>salt and pepper. Stir fry for 5-7 minutes, until vegetables are crisp-tender.<br><br>
        <b>Step 5:</b><br><br>
        Push the vegetables to the sides, making a well in the center. (Add a little more oil if the pan is dry.) Add the minced garlic and ginger,<br> if using. Saute without moving for about 1 minute, until fragrant, then stir into the rest of the vegetables.

        Transfer the <br>vegetables to a plate or bowl, and cover to keep warm.<br><br>
        <b>Step 6:</b><br><br>
        Add 2 more tablespoons of oil to the pan and heat over medium-high heat, until very hot. Add the chicken pieces in a single layer, <br>reserving any marinade left in the bowl for later. Cook for 2-3 minutes per side, until cooked through.<br> (You may need to cook in batches – don’t crowd the pan.)<br><br>
        <b>Step 6:</b><br><br>
        Add the vegetables back to the pan with the chicken. Pour 3 tablespoons of the remaining marinade over the chicken and veggies.<br> Increase heat to high, bring to a boil, and simmer for 2-3 minutes, until the sauce reduces and thickens.<br><br>
