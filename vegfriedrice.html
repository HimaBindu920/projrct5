        <p style="font-size:30px"><b><u>PREPARATION</u></b></p>
        <b>Step 1:</b><br><br>
        Heat a wok or a large skillet over high heat until very hot. Add 1 tablespoon of oil,<br> and then the broccoli, carrots, cabbage, zucchini, peppers, and edamame.<br><br>
        <b>Step 2:</b><br><br>
        Stir often until the vegetables are crisp-tender, about 4 minutes (they will get another few minutes to cook at the end of the <br>stir fry so it's ok if they're still crunchy right now). Transfer them to a plate and set aside.<br><br>
        <b>Step 3:</b><br><br>
        Return the wok to the burner over high heat, add the remaining tablespoon of oil, then add the cooled rice .<br> Stir fry, stirring occasionally, until it is lightly browned in spots, about 5 minutes.<br><br>
        <b>Step 4:</b><br><br>
        Add the ginger and the garlic to the rice, and stir until they're fragrant, about 1 minute. Add the soy sauce, <br>sesame oil, and 1/2 cup scallions.<br><br>
        <b>Step 5:</b><br><br>
        Return the vegetables and eggs to the wok with the rice. Cook, stirring often, until everything is combined and hot and the <br>vegetables are just tender, about 3 minutes. Taste and adjust the seasonings with salt and pepper, if needed.<br><br>
        <b>Step 6:</b><br><br>
        Sprinkle the additional scallions over the top, and serve right away, passing soy sauce on the side for those who want a bit more.<br><br>
