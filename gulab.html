        <p style="font-size:30px"><b><u>PREPARATION</u></b></p>
        <b>Step 1:</b><br><br>
        In a large bowl, stir together the milk powder, flour, baking powder, and cardamom.<br> Stir in the almonds, pistachios and golden raisins. Mix in the melted ghee, then pour<br>in the milk, and continue to mix until well blended. Cover and let rest for 20 minutes.<br><br>
        <b>Step 2:</b><br><br>
        In a large skillet, stir together the sugar, water, rose water and a pinch of cardamom. Bring to a boil, and simmer<br> for just a minute. Set aside.<br><br>
        <b>Step 3:</b><br><br>
        Fill a large heavy skillet halfway with oil. Heat over medium heat for at least 5 minutes. Knead the dough, <br>and form into about 20 small balls. Reduce the heat of the oil to low, and fry the balls in one or two batches.<br> After about 5 minutes, they will start to float, and expand to twice their original size, but the color will not change much. <br><br>
        <b>Step 4:</b><br><br>
        After the jamun float, increase the heat to medium, and turn them frequently until light golden. Remove from the oil<br> to paper towels using a slotted spoon, and allow to cool. Drain on paper towels and allow to cool slightly.<br><br>
        <b>Step 5:</b><br><br>
        Place the balls into the skillet with the syrup. Simmer over medium heat for about 5 minutes, squeezing them gently <br>to soak up the syrup. Serve immediately, or chill.<br><br>
