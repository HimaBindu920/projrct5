        <p style="font-size:30px"><b><u>PREPARATION</u></b></p>
        <b>Step 1:</b><br><br>
        In a bowl, combine chicken with all of the ingredients for the chicken marinade;<br> let marinate for 30 minutes to an hour (or overnight if time allows).<br><br>
        <b>Step 2:</b><br><br>
        Heat oil in a large skillet or pot over medium-high heat. When sizzling, add chicken pieces in batches of two or three,<br> making sure not to crowd the pan. Fry until browned for only 3 minutes on each side. Set aside and keep warm. <br>(You will finish cooking the chicken in the sauce.)<br><br>
        <b>Step 3:</b><br><br>
        Heat butter or ghee in the same pan. Fry the onions until they start to sweat (about 6 minutes) while scraping up any <br>browned bits stuck on the bottom of the pan.  <br><br>
        <b>Step 4:</b><br><br>
        Add garlic and ginger and sauté for 1 minute until fragrant, then add ground coriander, cumin and garam masala.<br> Let cook for about 20 seconds until fragrant, while stirring occasionally.<br><br>
        <b>Step 5:</b><br><br>
        Add crushed tomatoes, chili powder and salt. Let simmer for about 10-15 minutes, stirring occasionally until sauce thickens and <br>becomes a deep brown red colour.<br><br><br>
        <b>Step 6:</b><br><br>
        Remove from heat, scoop mixture into a blender and blend until smooth. You may need to add a couple tablespoons of <br>water to help it blend (up to 1/4 cup). Work in batches depending on the size of your blender.<br><br>
        <b>Step 7:</b><br><br>
        Pour the puréed sauce back into the pan. Stir the cream, sugar and crushed kasoori methi (or fenugreek leaves) through the sauce.<br> Add the chicken with juices back into the pan and cook for an additional 8-10 minutes until <br>chicken is cooked through and the sauce is thick and bubbling.<br><br>
        <b>Step 8:</b><br><br>
        Garnish with chopped cilantro and serve with fresh, hot garlic butter rice and fresh homemade Naan bread!<br><br>
