        <p style="font-size:30px"><b><u>PREPARATION</u></b></p>
        <b>Step 1:</b><br><br>
        Lightly oil an 8x8-inch baking dish.Set a large heatproof bowl over a pan of<br>simmering water to create a double boiler (the bowl should rest on the rim of the pan <br>and the bottom should not touch the surface of the water).<br><br>
        <b>Step 2:</b><br><br>
        Whisk together the egg yolks and 3/4 cup of the sugar in the bowl. Continue whisking until the sugar has dissolved, the mixture <br>has increased slightly in volume, and it looks light yellow color. Not sure? Rub a little of the mixture between two fingers <br>(it will be warm, but not too hot to touch) – it should feel smooth and silky; if you feel any sugar granules, keep whisking.<br><br>
        <b>Step 3:</b><br><br>
        Gradually whisk in 2 ounces (4 tablespoons) of the rum and continue whisking rapidly over the double boiler for about <br>10 minutes, until the mixture is thick, foamy, and very pale yellow. (You can also use a hand mixer for this step, if you prefer.)<br><br>
        <b>Step 4:</b><br><br>
        Remove the bowl from the double boiler and set aside until cooled to at least 90°F or room temperature.You can use either<br> a hand mixer or a stand mixer with a whisk attachment for this step. If using a stand mixer, be very attentive and do not <br>walk away while the mascarpone is whipping.<br><br>
        <b>Step 5:</b><br><br>
        Stand mixers are so powerful, that it's easy to overwhip, which causes the mascarpone to separate. You have a little more <br>wiggle room with a hand mixer.With a hand mixer or in the bowl of a stand mixer with a whisk attachment, beat the mascarpone <br>on medium speed for 15 to 30 seconds, until it smooths out and softens. <br><br>
        <b>Step 6:</b><br><br>
        Be careful not to over-beat or else the mascarpone will separate and become grainy.With the mixer still on medium speed, <br>gradually add the cream in a thin, slow stream until it's all incorporated. This should take 1 to 2 minutes. Stop the mixer <br>and scrape down the bowl. Continue beating with the mixer on medium-high speed for another 30 to 60 seconds, until the<br> mixture holds firm, not-quite-stiff peaks.<br><br>
        <b>Step 7:</b><br><br>
        Fold 1/3 of the whipped mascarpone-cream mixture into the zabaglione to lighten it, then fold in the remaining 2/3.In a wide,<br>shallow dish, whisk the remaining 1/4 cup sugar with the remaining 1 ounce (2 tablespoons) of rum, the boiling water, and the <br>espresso powder. Stir to dissolve the sugar and espresso.<br><br>
        <b>Step 8:</b><br><br>
        Dunk one ladyfinger at a time in the espresso liquid, turning it so that all sides are evenly moistened — a quick dunk is all you <br>need; any more and the ladyfingers start to disintegrate. Arrange the dunked ladyfingers in rows on the bottom of the <br>baking dish.<br><br>
        <b>Step 9:</b><br><br>
        Once you finish the layer, spread 1/2 of the mascarpone mixture over the top. Repeat dunking and arranging a second layer, and <br>spread the remaining mascarpone over top.Cover the tiramisu and refrigerate for at least 8 hours or up to 24 hours to give the<br> tiramisu time to firm up and for the ladyfingers to soften.<br><br>
        <b>Step 10:</b><br><br>
        Dust with cocoa before serving. Serve in wedges directly from the pan. Leftovers will keep for about 5 days.<br><br>
